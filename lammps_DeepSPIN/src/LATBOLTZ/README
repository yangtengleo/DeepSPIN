This package contains a LAMMPS implementation of a background
Lattice-Boltzmann fluid, which can be used to model MD particles
influenced by hydrodynamic forces.  Details of the package is
describe in :

C. Denniston, N. Afrasiabian, M.G. Cole-Andre, F.E. Mackay, S.T.T. Ollila, and  T. Whitehead, LAMMPS lb/fluid fix version 2: Improved Hydrodynamic Forces Implemented into LAMMPS through a lattice-Boltzmann fluid, Computer
Physics Communications 275 (2022) 108318.
or https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108318

See the doc page for the fix lb/fluid command to get started, and see
brief descriptions of other fixes below, each of which have their own
doc page.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/PACKAGES/latboltz.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This package can only be used if LAMMPS is compiled
with MPI (i.e. the serial makefile should not be used to compile the
code).  Also, several of the test examples provided make use of the
rigid fix and molecule packages.  Therefore, these should be included
in the LAMMPS build (see the "Including/excluding packages" section of
the LAMMPS manual).

The creators of this package are as follows:

Frances Mackay
Santtu Ollila
Tyson Whitehead
Colin Denniston, cdennist@uwo.ca
University of Western Ontario

Fixes provided by this package:

fix_lb_fluid.cpp:  fix used to create the lattice-Boltzmann fluid on a
		   grid covering the LAMMPS simulation domain.

fix_momentum_lb.cpp:  fix used to subtract off the total (atom plus fluid)
		      linear momentum from the system.

fix_viscous_lb.cpp:  fix to add the fluid force to the atoms when using a
		     built-in LAMMPS integrator.
