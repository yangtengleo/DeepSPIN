compute momentum command
========================

Syntax

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID momentum

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* momentum = style name of this compute command

Examples

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute 1 all momentum

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that calculates the translational momentum *p*
of a group of particles.  It is computed as the sum :math:`\vec{p} = \sum_i m_i \cdot \vec{v}_i`
over all particles in the compute group, where *m* and *v* are
the mass and velocity vector of the particle, respectively.

Output info
"""""""""""

This compute calculates a global vector (the summed momentum) of
length 3. This value can be used by any command that uses a global
vector value from a compute as input. See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` page for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector value calculated by this compute is "extensive". The vector
value will be in mass\*velocity :doc:`units <units>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This compute is part of the EXTRA-COMPUTE package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.
