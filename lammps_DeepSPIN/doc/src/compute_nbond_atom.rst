compute nbond/atom command
==========================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID nbond/atom

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* nbond/atom = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute 1 all nbond/atom

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that computes the number of bonds each atom is
part of.  Bonds which are broken are not counted in the tally.  See
the :doc:`Howto broken bonds <Howto_bpm>` page for more information.
The number of bonds will be zero for atoms not in the specified
compute group. This compute does not depend on Newton bond settings.

Output info
"""""""""""

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` doc page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the BPM package.
See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` doc page for more info.
