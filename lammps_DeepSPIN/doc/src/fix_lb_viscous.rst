   fix 1 flow lb/viscous

Description
"""""""""""

This fix is similar to the :doc:`fix viscous <fix_viscous>` command, and
is to be used in place of that command when a lattice-Boltzmann fluid
is present using the :doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>`.  This should be used in conjunction with one of the built-in LAMMPS integrators, such as :doc:`fix NVE <fix_nve>` or :doc:`fix rigid <fix_rigid>`.

This fix adds a viscous force to each atom to cause it move with the same velocity as the fluid (an equal and opposite force is applied to the fluid via :doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>`).  When :doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>` is called with the noise option, the atoms will also experience random forces which will thermalize them to the same temperature as the fluid.  In this way, the combination of this fix with :doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>` and a LAMMPS integrator like :doc:`fix NVE <fix_nve>` is analogous to :doc:`fix langevin <fix_langevin>` except here the fluid is explicit.  The temperature of the particles can be monitored via the scalar output of :doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>`.

For details of this fix, as well as descriptions and results of several
test runs, see :ref:`Denniston et al. <fluid-Denniston2>`.  Please include a citation to

research.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As described in the :doc:`fix viscous <fix_viscous>` documentation:

"No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the :doc:`minimize <minimize>` command.  This fix should only
be used with damped dynamics minimizers that allow for
non-conservative forces.  See the :doc:`min_style <min_style>` command
for details."

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the LATBOLTZ package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.

Can only be used if a lattice-Boltzmann fluid has been created via the
:doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>` command, and must come after this
command.
