These Python scripts help to detect whether files in the repository
conform to LAMMPS coding conventions or not, and can fix those issues, too.

permissions.py   detects if sources have executable permissions and scripts have not
whitespace.py    detects TAB characters and trailing whitespace
homepage.py      detects outdated LAMMPS homepage URLs (pointing to sandia.gov instead of lammps.org)
errordocs.py     detects deprecated error docs in header files
